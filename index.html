                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Multiverse of Geekiness is a single/multiplayer adventure game that will rely on constantly evolving
                    gameplay. The player(s) will have to traverse and survive through different geek-culture
                    "universes". The game will keep the player(s) interested not only thanks to varying different
                    backdrops and challenges but also by conserving a clear linearity.</p>

                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Our Hero, whose name is yet to be decided, has made a terrible discovery: his world is about to die.
                    Luckily, he found ancient murals describing how an ancient civilization was able to save their
                    planet using a rare stone. However, the location of said gem is not disclosed, only the tale of its
                    guardian.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>The player will have to find a gem to save his world by accessing the End Dimension as quickly as
                    possible. He will then have to defeat the guardian and search for the stone that can only be spotted
                    once the guardian has been defeated. To find the End Dimension, the player will have to jump through
                    portals and travel through the multiverse. Each world/dimension/universe will represent different
                    game types and use mainly two views, namely from above and the side. The game will feature different
                    entities, or mobs, that can hurt the player or help him. The player(s) can then utilize the
                    different features to their advantage, that is using peaceful entities for themselves, or using
                    aggressive entities to block or slow down the other player. One of the key features of the game is
                    the use of different game styles. This should allow for a lot of variations in fight mechanics and
                    weapon use. The end fight should be the last...</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Beginning</h2>
                <p> In the solo mode, the player will spawn in a hub with basic loot. He will then have a choice between
                    several Portals, each one allowing the player to go to a different world. The player will be able to
                    return to his spawn hub if he finds the necessary Portals. Those Portals might be different from the
                    one he took to go to one of the world.
                </p>
                <p> The multiplayer mode will follow the same mechanics. The only difference will be that each player
                    will be able to access his, and only his spawn hub, whether it is from dying or by following a
                    portal.
